Was final project for Mizzou Course in Object Oriented Programming as well as Data Structures

In order to get this project to work properly, you will need to have some means of hosting a SQL 
database. This project was written in NetBeans using an API (JDBC connector) to connect to a MySQL databse 
hosted using MySQL workbench. 

Once you import the database from the included SQL file, you might need to calibrate the program to
your system. On line 27 and 28 of the abstract class DBRequest.java has a username and password 
setup for my current configuration of the database server. 

Also, in the same class on line 42 is the pathway to where the database is being hosted, which m
might be different depending on your own configuration.
